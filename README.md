⚾ Replay Institute - Google Sheets Screening Automation

This repository contains the Apps Script code used to automate a screening process for Replay Baseball Institute.
The system is built on Google Sheets and designed to help staff efficiently evaluate new members of their program based on key athletic metrics.

📌 Project Overview

Replay Baseball Institute conducts athletic screenings for potential new members. These screenings measure:

Mobility

Strength

Power

Rotation

Arm strength and health

This project streamlines the data entry and reporting process by adding custom functionality to Google Sheets via a custom dropdown menu. The result is a more efficient, automated experience for staff during evaluations.

⚙️ Key Features

A custom dropdown menu provides staff with three automated actions:

1. Add to Database

After a screening is completed, staff select this option.

They're prompted to enter the athlete's first and last name.

All screening data is then automatically transferred to a master database under the athlete’s name.

✅ Eliminates the need for manual data entry into the database.

2. Clear Screening Sheet

Used immediately after a player's data has been stored.

This function clears all fields in the screening sheet, resetting it for the next athlete.

✅ Saves time by avoiding manual clearing.

3. Generate Slide for Player

Staff enter a player's first and last name to retrieve stored screening results.

The system:

Locates the player's data in the database

Creates a copy of a template slide in Google Slides

Automatically fills in the copied slide with the player's screening results

✅ Provides a professional, visual report for communication or internal use.

🔒 Important Notes

To keep this repository clear and focused, some supporting files—such as the HTML interface files and .clasp.json configuration—have been intentionally excluded.

The main purpose is to highlight the core Apps Script (macro) code that drives the project’s functionality.

This repo serves as an archival and demonstration resource. For live usage or further development, clone the repo and link it to your own Apps Script project using clasp.
